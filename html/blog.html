                    <h2>Write your mind on what changes the pandemic brought to 
                        your life.</h2>
                    <p>I am 19 years old and never thought that such a scary period will come in my life. I was 
                        preparing for my entrance exams suddenly news came that there will be a complete shutdown in 
                        the country. It was so shocking and hard to believe. I never thought that such a small organism 
                        can create havoc around the world. I never thought that something from the other country can 
                        spread so quickly in my country. I was scared when the cases started to rise in my country.
                        I was surprised to see the changes happening all around. Just after the last day of my board exam, 
                        news came that there will be a complete lockdown in the country until further notice. The fear 
                        was so much because everything was changing so quickly. It was the worst time of my life 
                        because my parents are doctors. I saw them working day and night to save the lives of the 
                        people. It was for the first time in my life that I did not see my parents for a week. They did not 
                        return home and had to stay in the hospital to save the lives of other people. It was a tough time 
                        for my family because I had to live without my parents when they were also risking their lives to 
                        save other peopleâ€™s lives. But, I am proud of my parents that they had saved the lives of suffering 
                        people during such a difficult time. </p>
